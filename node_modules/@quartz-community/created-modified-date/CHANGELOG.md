## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Widen the `@napi-rs/simple-git` peer range to `^0.1.19 || ^1.0.0`.

  Quartz core now depends on `@napi-rs/simple-git@1.x`, which fell outside the previous
  peer range and caused `npm install`/`npm ci` to fail with ERESOLVE. Widening is additive
  and does not break existing consumers on 0.1.x.

# Changelog

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Stable 1.0 release. All `@quartz-community/*` dependencies now use `^1.0.0` ranges.

  Pre-1.0 caret ranges pinned the minor version (`^0.2.1` means `>=0.2.1 <0.3.0`), so
  published fixes to shared packages could never be resolved by dependents. Moving the
  ecosystem to 1.0 makes caret ranges behave conventionally.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
