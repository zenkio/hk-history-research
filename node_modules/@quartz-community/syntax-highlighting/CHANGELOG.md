## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Add `shiki` to devDependencies so the package can be built from source.

  `shiki` was declared only as a required peer dependency. Quartz sets
  `legacy-peer-deps=true` in its root `.npmrc`, which npm inherits when the plugin loader
  runs `npm install` inside `.quartz/plugins/`. Peers are then not auto-installed, so
  building this plugin from a `github:` source failed with `Could not resolve "shiki"`.

  Declaring it as a devDependency guarantees build-time availability. It is pruned by the
  loader afterwards via `npm prune --omit=dev`, and remains a peer for consumers.

# Changelog

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Stable 1.0 release. All `@quartz-community/*` dependencies now use `^1.0.0` ranges.

  Pre-1.0 caret ranges pinned the minor version (`^0.2.1` means `>=0.2.1 <0.3.0`), so
  published fixes to shared packages could never be resolved by dependents. Moving the
  ecosystem to 1.0 makes caret ranges behave conventionally.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
